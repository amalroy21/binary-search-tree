## INTRODUCTION

`BinarySearchTree` is responsible for building a binary search tree from the given list of integers and perform deletion of nodes according to users requirement.

## SUMMARY
Given a list of integers, this program will build a binary search tree and delete nodes according to the user. You are required to provide the integers in the config file which the program reads and performs its algorithm on.

## PREREQUISITES
* `Java 1.8` is needed to build/run this project

## INPUT
* Use `Config.properties` to enter the integers required to build and perform binary search tree actions. 


## GETTING STARTED
1. open a terminal/console window
2. `cd path/to/binary-search-tree`
3. Open `Config.properties` and enter the list you want to perform BST actions.
4. Run `Main.class` and you will get the required BST as the output.
